# Sui Payment Kit

A robust, open-source payment processing toolkit for the Sui blockchain that provides secure payment verification, receipt management, and duplicate prevention.

## Overview

The Sui Payment Kit is a Move smart contract framework that enables developers to integrate secure, verifiable payments into their Sui applications. It provides a flexible architecture for payment processing with optional receipt persistence, configurable expiration policies, and built-in duplicate prevention.

### Key Features

- **Secure Payment Processing**: Built-in duplicate prevention and exact amount verification
- **Flexible Receipt Management**: Optional receipt persistence with configurable expiration
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: All payments emit events for off-chain tracking
- **Admin Controls**: Capability-based access control for registry management
- **Modular Design**: Extensible configuration system for future enhancements
- **Multi-Coin Support**: Generic implementation supports any Sui coin type

## How It Works

### Architecture

The Sui Payment Kit consists of three main components:

1. **Payment Processing Core**: Handles coin transfers and validation
2. **Registry System**: Optional persistent storage for payment receipts
3. **Configuration Layer**: Dynamic, upgradeable configuration management

### Duplicate Prevention

Sui Payment Kit prevents duplicate payments using a composite key derived from:

- Payment ID (nonce)
- Amount
- Coin type
- Receiver address

This ensures the same payment cannot be processed twice.

## Use Cases

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Track customer payments and order fulfillment
- **Subscription Services**: Manage recurring payments with receipt tracking
- **Digital Marketplaces**: Process payments between buyers and sellers
- **DeFi Applications**: Integrate payment verification into financial protocols
- **Gaming Platforms**: Handle in-game purchases and microtransactions

## Security Considerations

- **Admin Capabilities**: Store `RegistryAdminCap` objects securely
- **Payment Validation**: Always verify amounts match business logic requirements
- **Unique IDs**: Use cryptographically secure methods for generating payment IDs
- **Gas Optimization**: Consider storage costs when enabling receipt persistence
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls in integrating applications
